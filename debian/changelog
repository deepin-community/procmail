  * Use config.h to override things in autoconf.h that might not be detected
    by autoconf correctly. This undefines NO_COMSAT and gives proper values
    for UDP_protocolno and BIFF_serviceport (will hopefully fix Bug#348667).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Feb 2006 00:09:08 +0100

procmail (3.22-14) unstable; urgency=low

    and only when the architecture needs it (Closes: #236685).
  * Headers User-Agent: and NNTP-Posting-Date: are now recognized by formail
    when splitting messages (Closes: #295604).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  1 Mar 2005 16:35:56 +0100

procmail (3.22-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified autoconf to hardcode 127.0.0.1 as the address for localhost,

    filenames and retries on name collision. It also contains some
    bug fixes from the 3.23pre snapshot dated 2001-09-13.

    have `exim' (the default Debian MTA) and `mail-transport-agent'.
  * Removed suidmanager support. Conflicts: suidmanager (<< 0.50).
  * Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS in the source package.
  * README.Maildir: Do not use locking on the example recipe,

procmail (3.10.7-5) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added a patch for Maildir support. The "new" procmail should be
    completely backwards compatible with the "previous" one, in the

    Maildir folders.

  * Rewritten copyright file.
  * initmake unmodified (source).

    /etc/procmailrc. Default value is "yes" (i.e. wait a second).
  * Added a small note about this in /usr/doc/procmail/README.Debian.
